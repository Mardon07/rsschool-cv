### Briefly About Myself:
_In 2021, I decided to study IT, I started by studying html and css, spent three months studying layout, then I realized that this was not enough and I had to sign up for paid courses, since I didn’t know what to learn in order to become a front-end developer , but I did not have enough funds to continue my studies, after a year I saved up enough money to afford these courses, and now on the eve of 2023, I am finishing courses in front-end development and wanted to start my career at Epam , but it turns out for you need to finish special courses from rsschool, well, what can you do, don’t throw everything halfway, signed up for rsschool courses and started doing the first task_
